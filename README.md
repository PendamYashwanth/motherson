# Personal Portfolio Website Development

I recently crafted this personal portfolio website as part of the Motherson recruitment process. Visit the website [here](https://assignment.yashwanthpendam.com/).

## Project Description
Built using React JS v18.2.0, this project showcases my skills in implementing HTML semantic tags, CSS variables, and media queries to ensure a structured and responsive design. The use of context in passing props minimizes code redundancy. I've also implemented logic for navigating through navigation links, dynamically adding projects, and utilizing local storage to persist data on the user's device.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- React JS v18.2.0

## Project Features
- Responsive design for seamless viewing on various devices
- Smooth navigation to different sections and projects
- Able to add projects dynamically
- Ability to access published project through the "View Project" feature

## Challenges and Solutions
- In the design file, there was no input to collect the image URL directly. To address this, I implemented a solution by maintaining a list of image URLs and dynamically generating a random image from the list. This was achieved using the Math.random() and Math.floor() functions to select a random index from the list, providing a dynamic image URL for display..

## Deployment
The portfolio is deployed on [Hostinger](https://www.hostinger.com/) using a subdomain. You can access it at [here](https://assignment.yashwanthpendam.com/).
